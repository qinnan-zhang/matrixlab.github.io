Hi, I am Qinnan Zhang

I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Future Blockchain and Privacy Computing Advanced Innovation Center, Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Beihang University, working with Prof [Zhiming Zheng](https://iai.buaa.edu.cn/info/1013/1088.htm), an Academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences（中国科学院院士）. I am also a Principal Investigator (PI) of the Matrix Lab, which focuses on the intersection of Blockchain Security and Privacy Computing. 


I pursued my Ph.D. from 2019 to 2024 in the School of Information, Central University of Finance and Economics, supervised by Prof. [Jianming Zhu](https://ie.cufe.edu.cn/info/1387/6224.htm). My research interests lie in federated learning incentive mechanisms, blockchain transaction detection, smart contract vulnerability mining, and differential privacy. If you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me by email (zhangqn@buaa.edu.cn).
